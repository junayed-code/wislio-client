# Wislio

Wislio is a book library management web application. This app is built with modern web development libraries like React, React Router, Tailwindcss, Formik, Swiperjs, and many more. I used Firebase for user authentication. This app design is not so good, but it's awesome.

## App features

- This app has two themes light and dark. User can switch between two themes.
- This app has protected routes. Only logged-in users can access those routes.
- User can register their account with email and password.
- User also resgister their account with their google account.
- User can logout their account or sign in account using email and password.
- This app has strong form validation. No one can submit their form without validating the form.
- A registered user can borrow books and the user can return the borrowed books.
- This app has role-based authorization system.
- A librarian role user can add and update books. But a normal user can't do this. To explore this feature sign-in email: `librarian@wislio.com` and password: `Librarian@`
